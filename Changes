Revision history for Perl extension Net::SMTP_auth.

        - After upgraing Net:SMTP to version 2.26 I noticed that
          authentication was broken (the response of AUTH does not equal
          CMD_OK anymore but CMD_MORE).
        - PLEASE NOTE: Net::SMTP can handle authentication by its own.

	- changed MIME::Base64 function calls
        - changed authentication to use Authen::SASL instead of
          selfmade routines. I currently tested only CRAM-MD5, LOGIN
          and PLAIN.
          Can someone please provide me with a SMTP account on a 
          maschine using DIGEST-MD5 or NTLM?
