Abstract
--------

Net::SMTP_auth is a small extension to G. Barr's Net::SMTP
to authenticate to an SMTP server using one of the AUTH
methods PLAIN, LOGIN or CRAM-MD5 (see RFC2554 for details).
This module can be expanded and is a very first implementation.

------------
Requirements
------------

This module requires:
 
   - Net::SMTP (should be obvious)
   - MIME::Base64
   - Digest::HMAC_MD5

The requirements are encoded in Makefile.PL.  

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

Net::SMTP_auth may be installed through the CPAN shell in the
usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::SMTP_auth'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme Net::SMTP_auth

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install Net::SMTP_auth

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

Net::SMTP_auth can also be installed manually.  

Download the package from:

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for

  make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.
